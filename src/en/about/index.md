aboutBox1Text: "Thanks to Open Source frameworks **Symfony** and **Vue.js**, I help my clients with deploying solutions that are **efficient, modern and maintainable**."
aboutSection1Title: Benefit from a fast and efficient API.
aboutSection1Text: |
  By combining **Symfony** on the backend and **Vue.js** on the frontend, I create dynamic applications that communicate efficiently. Whether for web interfaces, web applications, or integrated with third-party APIs, this approach offers optimal flexibility.

  Therefore, deploying a single-page-application (SPA) and implementing reusable components becomes quick and straightforward. This ensures a **smooth user experience** and more efficient **project management**.
aboutSection2Title: Modern and proven techniques.
aboutSection2Text: |
  I enhance the solidity of the source code by integrating practices such as implementing **unit tests** and using **TypeScript**. This approach ensures a smooth deployment, minimizing side effects and regressions. Thus, your project benefits from a **solid foundation**, promoting peace of mind during releases in production.
aboutSection3Title: Benefit from a well-organized and accessible source code.
aboutSection3Text: |
  Ensuring that the delivered code can be maintained and knowing how to **manage the technical debt** are crucial issues. This is why I opt for **Open Source** systems that provide the necessary longevity, supported by a solid foundation of community-driven contributions, with **frequent and verified** updates. Thus, the deployment of your code comes with an assurance of sustainability.
aboutBox2Title: WordPress / JAMStack development
aboutBox2Text: |
  To allow you to benefit from a **simple and familiar administration**, or for projects requiring **maximum execution speed**, I use **WordPress** and the **JAMStack**.
aboutSection4Title: WordPress, the Swiss Army knife of the web.
aboutSection4Text: |
  Whether for a **showcase website**, news publishing through **a blog**, or an **online booking system**, WordPress's reputation speaks for itself. With its **simple administration interface**, you'll be able to manage your website independently.
aboutSection5Title: A solution tailored for your needs.

  Regardless of the problem at hand, I create **a custom theme** that closely aligns with the expressed needs. This approach simplifies website updates and ensures optimal compatibility with new versions of the WordPress Core and the plugins used.
aboutSection6Title: Static sites, a return to basics.
aboutSection6Text: |
  Because they excel in terms of **speed** and **security**, I use **static site generators** to offer solutions that enable a rapid deployment, while benefiting from ease of updating and maintainability. Thanks to **Gridsome** or **Eleventy**, it's possible to smoothly and afforably launch a fast, flexible and extremely lightweight website.

  I'm making use of my experience in **teamwork** and my penchant for effective **productivity methods** to deploy robust, user-friendly, and maintainable code.
method1Title: Code
method1Text: |
  I work with an **RWD / Mobile First** approach for the frontend. I ensure the robustness of my backend code through unit tests.
method2Title: Workflow
method2Text: |
  Thanks to my **SCRUM experience**, I can work alone or in a team. I can also implement a **Continuous Integration** workflow that helps prevent regressions.
method3Title: Best practices
