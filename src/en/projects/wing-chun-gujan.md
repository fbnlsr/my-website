  **Benjamin Gourven** is a self-defense instructor in Gujan, a small town in the south west of France. He wanted a website that would present his activities as well as allow him to showcase a few pictures of his martial arts seminars.

The website is fairly simple, and since the client did not want to bother with a tedious admin system, we agreed to use **Hugo** as a static website generator.

The whole project is hosted on **Netlify**, with an SSL certificate provided by **Let's Encrypt**, and deploys itself automatically from Github.
