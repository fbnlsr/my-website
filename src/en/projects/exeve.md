  **Exeve** is a web application made for auction houses.
---

The application provides auctioneers with complete management of their inventory prior to a sale. Offering a robust API to an Android/iOS mobile app, Exeve streamlines the creation and management of a photo catalog of items intended for auction.

The platform also enables the organization and real-time monitoring of auctions â€” from catalog planning and preparation to live sale tracking through a synchronized dashboard.

The user interface is built with Vue.js, delivering a smooth and responsive experience, while the backend is powered by Symfony, ensuring robustness and scalability.
