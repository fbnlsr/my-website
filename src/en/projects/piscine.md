  **La Piscine** is a French training center offering intensive training for aspiring developers, designers and database administrators. Between 2018 and 2020, I tought JavaScript and jQuery there.

Sharing knowledge is an amazing experience. Beyond JavaScript, I teach my students **basic programming notions**, from variables to the **notion of objects**, including JSON and AJAX.

I then use the flexibility of the jQuery selector to allow them to **manipulate the DOM** and use the **Event Listener** to add more interactivity to their web projects.

Finally, they learn what is an API, and bring all this together by building a **complete jQuery plugin**, which respects the library's ecosystem. During the whole training, I insist on the importance of delivering quality code and answer all the questions they might have on the reality of what it is to be a web developer.
