description: |
  **18-55 Productions** is a video production company based in Bordeaux, France.

  For their website, they needed something simple which would put their work upfront as well as the various talents whom work with them.
---

The main focus for this project was to produce a website that would not interfere with the content it’s presenting. 18-55 Productions being a video/movie production company, it was important to come up with a design that would **enhance the projects** and not be too forward with its own identity.

The client also wanted a **user-friendly** way to organize and maintain the different sections as well as the homepage. That’s why the website makes an extensive use of **Advanced Custom Fields** for Wordpress.
