  **Healthy Warriors** is a yoga class based in Paris, as well as a fitness center and a healthy caf√©.

  For their website, they needed something visually attractive which would inform their student about the upcoming classes and present the various teachers.

**Modularity** was the key concept for this project as not only this yoga class is the home for dozens of teachers coming from around the world, but it's also a place were several yoga disciplines are being taught.

The use of a **tooltip system** triggered by mouse-hover effects and Wordpress **Custom Post Types** allowed us to present these combinations.
