excerpt: "New project online! This time for CFA Le Vigean, a training center for multiple hand crafts."
---
Print and Web Agency ComTogether has asked me to develop the new website for [CFA Le Vigean](http://cfa-levigean.fr), a formation center for students in various fields (dentistry, woodworking, geomatics engineering…).

The home page was designed internally by the agency, and the client was confident enough to trust me for the layout of the rest of the site, as well as the UX approach for the responsive design.

The base has been done using Wordpress, and several Custom Posts had to be made for the website not only offers students a place where they can gather informations regarding the various majors the school offers, but it’s also a place for employers and graduates to exchange.

Thanks to ComTogether for this project.
