Behind this smart title is a reminder to myself that I should start posting more. Writing about the web and its technologies has been something I've always wanted to do but I've been so focused on work lately that I completely forgot about it. Or at least I completely forgot about taking the time to do it.

I'm still considering whether I should cross-post the articles I'll be writing here on [Medium](https://medium.com/@fbnlsr) or not. All the cool kids are using this tool, maybe I should too. I've [written a piece](https://medium.com/@fbnlsr/the-three-pillars-of-a-developer-s-mind-ab4be1d93d99#.ksxafk9g5) there, which has had quiet a good feedback, so I might post more about my thoughts regarding the "mind" behind web development (and web developers).

This first post of 2017 could be a great way to wish everyone a happy new year! Let's hope that this year will be as awesome as possible for everyone. It's been pretty good so far for me, and I can't wait to see what's coming in the following months.

Since last month I've been learning Symfony. I have to admit that I had some presumptions towards this framework, not really knowing why. I had heard it was hard to learn, badly written and all in all confusing. I am really surprised to see that it is in fact really well put together and pretty easy to learn (to some extent of course). I can't wait to put what I've been learning to practice and really start working with it.

I've also been looking at vue.js with a real interest. It looks so slick and powerful! I already have an idea of a cool app I could put together that'd make use of both technologies. But hey, the [E-League Major](http://www.eleague.com/major/) has started yesterday, so no time for that yet. :)

Anyways, onwards to 2017 and let's hope I'll get some time to fill these columns sooner than later!
