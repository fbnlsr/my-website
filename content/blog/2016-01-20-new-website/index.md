It’s been a long time coming, but I’ve finally updated this website. Welcome!

With this new website, I’m saying goodbye to Jekyll, and hello Wordpress. I’ve always been a fan of Jekyll, and I still use it today for some of my projects. But lately I’ve been toying around with Wordpress and it’s come a long way over the past few years. It’s now a nice ecosystem to work with, and it will allow me to update this blog faster than before. Fortunately this also means I’ll get to spend more time writing about my projects and how I work.

Unfortunately, most of my work comes with an NDA which prevents me from publicly disclose the projects I’m working on. However, thanks to the folks at [quasardb](http://www.quasardb.net/), I was able to put together a simple “case study” which describes how I put together an app which is used almost everyday in the company. It’s always nice to work with passionate people on an interesting project, and while this particular one was not the biggest I’ve worked on, it was a really rewarding experience.

Oh, and if you’re wondering, yes I’m available to work on your project, so be sure to give me a call or drop me an email so we can discuss about it!
