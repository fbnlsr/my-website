I’ve developed the new website for [Agence Saint Germain](http://www.asgparis.com/) in collaboration with [Ligne 13](https://www.ligne13.com/). Agence Saint Germain is an agency for photographers, make-up artists, stylists and set designers. Their goal is to promote and sell the services of the artists that are signed with them.

It was a really interesting project, as the technical challenge was pretty special. For this site, I had to make use of Masonry, while allowing the website to be able to manage several picture sizes and orientations, have a parallax effect, and be responsive. The task was not the simplest, but I’m happy with the result.

The whole thing is backed by Wordpress. The client had a precise idea of the kind of experience he wanted for his users, and I find the end result very interesting. The use of white space gives all its importance to what matters: the pictures. A custom made lightbox was added, which allows people to select photos and save for later.

Thanks a lot to [Ligne 13](https://www.ligne13.com/) for this project !
