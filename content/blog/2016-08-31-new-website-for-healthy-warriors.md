I had the opportunity to work once again with [Ligne 13](https://www.ligne13.com/), this time for Healthy Warriors!

Healthy Warriors is a yoga center and café in Paris, regrouping several yoga teachers from around the globe. It has been created by Aria Crescendo and Gus Forristal, and features guest teachers and seminars throughout the year.

The website in itself is fairly simple, and is supported by WordPress. A few custom post types and custom pages had to be made in order to give the client the freedom to customize the articles available in the shop as well as dishes and drinks served at the bar.

Thanks again to [Ligne 13](https://www.ligne13.com/) for this project!
