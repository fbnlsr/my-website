On New Year's Eve, I've been telling this joke for years:

> "My new year resolution? Well, 1920x1080, same as last year!"

*drum roll.*

While this joke is absolutely not funny and not even true (I'm running a dual screen setup now), I figured I'd stop for a minute and think about a few things I could do to make 2018 an even better year than this year was.

2017 has been a year of discoveries and challenges. I went on throughout the year trying to learn how to be a good dad, and I've encountered some professional challenges that were pretty rough to overcome. I've also lost about 10 kg (yay!) and suffered from an arm injury (meh!) that has been bugging me for more than half the year.

Now that the year is ending, I thought I'd stop with that stupid joke, pause for a moment and try to write down five things that I could experiment in order to live a happier life. So here are my resolutions for 2018.

## No sugar, no alcohol

I've always had a problem with food, and especially sugar. I admit, I do have a sweet tooth. Even though it never really showed, now that I'm slowly approaching my 40s the effects of eating too much sugar are showing. I've been slightly overweight for years. Not enough so that taking a flight of stairs makes me catch a sweat, but enough to being interested in getting rid of that habit.

After watching a few documentaries on Netflix (Fed Up and That Sugar Film, both highly recommended), I realized that I had a real problem with sugar. My biggest weakness being chocolate. So I've started surveilling my eating habits. I've also started doing Intermittent Fasting. Overall my health is much better and I feel great.

As for the alcohol part, well I don't have a problem with it. It's just that I find it hard to handle the social convention to drink when in a group or at a party. It might sound stupid but that's something I never understood. So from now on, I'll drink only if I *really* feel like it, and not just because it's the social norm.

## Work better, not more

It took me three years before taking my first vacation, and I felt guilty about it. Being a freelance agent means that you're free to work any time you want, of course. But people usually don't realize that most of the time it means you just never stop working. In 2018, I want to take pleasure working on the projects I choose. I also want to work more efficiently, not 7 days a week until 9 PM like I've been doing for the past five years. I've been trying to force myself to have a daily schedule, and stop working by 6 PM. I've also started working in a coworking environment. The experience has been great and I'm really eager to start working in the morning. So that's something I'll be pursuing.

## Sleep

This is probably the hardest resolution to adopt. 2017 has been a rough on my circadian rhythm, and I've already posted about my hectic sleep patterns. In 2018, I need to find a schedule that allow me to sleep at least 7 hours a night. This might sound easy to some, but I've had phases where I slept only 4 to 6 hours five days in a row before crashing for 10+ hours on the weekend. It's not a good thing to do, and even though I'm usually a night owl, I now *have* to wake up early. So if I want to live past 60, I need to sleep more.

## Write More

Now this probably looks like the easiest resolution to follow, but I'm not fooled. In 2018, I want to write more. Especially blog posts. I've always loved writing, and I never really *took the time* to do so. Last month I bought a notebook and started jotting down notes. Writing feels refreshing, as it allows me to slow down a bit and think for a minute.

## Worry less about others

This is a very personal resolution. It might sound like I need to become an asshole, but the truth is I worry way too much about others. I tend to attach too much value to one's word, or to their opinion, and it slowly kills me. I'm often left out being tired and disapointed. So I need to focus more on me, and worry less about others. In 2018, I want to work on being more emotionally autonomous.

2018 is going to be an exciting year.
