  Healthy Warriors is a yoga class based in Paris, as well as a fitness center and a healthy caf√©.

  For their website, they needed something visually attractive which would inform their student about the upcoming classes and present the various teachers.

  <strong>Modularity</strong> was the key concept for this project as not only this yoga class is the home for dozens of teachers coming from around the world, but it's also a place were several yoga disciplines are being taught.

  The use of a <strong>tooltip system</strong> triggered by mouse-hover effects and Wordpress <strong>Custom Post Types</strong> allowed us to present these combinations.
