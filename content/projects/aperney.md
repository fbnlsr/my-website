  **Cabinet A. Perney** is a real estate expertise firm based in Bordeaux.

  Since the scope of this project called for peculiar measures, a whole team was put together to answer the client's problematics.
longDescription: |
  What seemed to be a simple project at first (a corporate website like plenty) came out to be a real dive into the different aspects of what a real estate expert can do. The twist for this project was that since the client has ties to the **French judicial system**, words had to be chosen very carefully. For this, I called for help and thanks to [**RÃ©dactographe**](https://www.redactographe.com/), we were able to build a **whole lexical field** around the client's desires and abilities.

  And since the company was in the middle of an administrative rehaul, Elsa from [**Studio Mund**](http://studiomund.fr/) did a complete design for the client, including a new logo, a complete visual identity and stationaries.

  As for me, I wanted to try something new, so I stitched all this together using **Kirby**, a PHP-based flat-file CMS. It was really interesting to work with this CMS, and the ability to build a **custom admin panel** made it possible to offer the client a completely customized environment for his project.

  The end result is a solid, fast and **fast, robust, custom-tailored** website that's **easy to deploy and maintain**.
