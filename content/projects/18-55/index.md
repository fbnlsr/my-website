**18-55 Productions** is a video production company based in Bordeaux, France.

For their website, they needed something simple which would put their work upfront as well as the various talents whom work with them.

The main focus for this project was to produce a website that would not interfere with the content it’s presenting. 18-55 Productions being a video/movie production company, it was important to come up with a design that would **enhance the projects** and not be too forward with its own identity.

The client also wanted a **user-friendly** way to organize and maintain the different sections as well as the homepage. That’s why the website makes an extensive use of **Advanced Custom Fields** for Wordpress.
