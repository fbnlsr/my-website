description: |
  Benjamin Gourven is a self-defense instructor in Gujan, a small town in the south west of France. He wanted a website that would present his activities as well as allow him to showcase a few pictures of his martial arts seminars.
longDescription: |
  The website is fairly simple, and since the client did not want to bother with a tedious admin system, we aggreed to use Hugo as a static website generator.

  The whole project is hosted on Netlify, with an SSL certificate provided by Let's Encrypt, and deploys itself automatically from Github.
