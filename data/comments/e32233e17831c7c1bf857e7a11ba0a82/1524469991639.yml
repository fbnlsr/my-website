comment: "@Arthur: If you're talking about the TODO Highlight screenshot, it comes from the plugin page and apparently it's the [Material Night](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.Theme-MaterialKit) theme.\r\n\r\nI personally use [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) with [IBM Plex Mono](https://www.ibm.com/plex/). I couldn't work with a light theme. After a while my eyes get sore. If you like light-colored theme though, I suggest you try out [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) as well."
