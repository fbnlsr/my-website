# Primative - Website

[https://primative.net](https://primative.net)

This is my personal website. It was made using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Once cloned, use `yarn` or `npm install` to fetch all dependencies.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This will run `webpack` to build the CSS and Javascript, and `hugo` to generate the site.

## Serve

```bash
npm run serve
```

This will do the same as `npm run build`, and will monitor changes for any `.scss` or `.js` file.
