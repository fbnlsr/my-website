# Fabien Lasserre - Website

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/e5c7f5ad-5764-42e2-9f03-aa8d74526160/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/primative/deploys)

This is my personal website. It was made using [11ty](https://11ty.dev/).

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This will build the site in the `dist` directory.

## Serve

```bash
npm start
```

This will do the same as `npm run build`, and run 11ty's built-in web server.
